# ANN - Artificial Neural Network in Machine Learning.

# Its an information processing system inspired by the biological neural Network.

# An artificial neuron network (neural network) is a computational model that mimics the way nerve
cells work in the human brain.

# Application of ANN

-- Social Media
-- Sales and Marketing
-- Healthcare
-- Image Compression , etc.

# Perceptron

•It is the simplest type of feedforward neural network, consisting of a single layer of input
nodes that are fully connected to a layer of output nodes.
