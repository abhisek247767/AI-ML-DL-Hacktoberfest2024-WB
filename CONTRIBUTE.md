# Pull Request Guidelines

Hey there, contributor! ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to our repository!

## What You Need to Know Before Submitting a PR

### 1. Branch Naming Conventions
When you create a new branch, please use one of the following formats:
- `{project name}`

Just replace `{your project}` with a short, descriptive name that captures what youâ€™re working on.

### 2. Testing Your Code
We want to make sure everything works perfectly, so please:
- Write unit tests for any new features or bug fixes.
- Run the test suite to ensure everything passes before you submit your PR. 

### 3. Updating Documentation
If your changes affect any part of the documentation, please update it! Clear and concise documentation helps everyone understand the project better.
