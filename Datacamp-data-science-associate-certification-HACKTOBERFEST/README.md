A repo containing a notebook and a dataset file
## Data science associate certification on datacamp.com
The project was about determining if review feedback was provided by an owner or a non-owner of a bike using logistic regression as the base line model and knn as the comparing model. Feel free to contact me about anything related to this.

A tutorial project Hacktoberfest for whoever is interested, a newbie mostly in data science mostly. 
electric_bike_ratings_2212 is the dataset. You can play around. Enjoy Ciao.
