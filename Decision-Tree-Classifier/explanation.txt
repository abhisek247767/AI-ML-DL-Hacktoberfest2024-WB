Explanation:

A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. 
It models decisions and their possible consequences as a tree-like structure, where:

Internal nodes represent decision points based on a feature.
Branches represent the outcome of those decisions.
Leaf nodes represent the final prediction (class labels in classification or numerical values in regression).
The algorithm splits the data recursively based on the feature that provides the highest information gain or the lowest Gini impurity. 
The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on input features.

Key Concepts:
Information Gain: Measures the reduction in entropy after splitting the dataset on a feature.
Gini Impurity: Measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified. The lower the Gini value, the better 
the split.

Advantages:
Easy to understand and visualize.
Requires minimal data preprocessing (no normalization or scaling).
Can handle both categorical and numerical data.

Disadvantages:
Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
Sensitive to small changes in data (can result in different trees).

Real-Life Applications of Decision Trees:

Credit Scoring: Decision Trees are used in banks to evaluate if a person is eligible for a loan. 
By analyzing a customerâ€™s past financial data, income, and other factors, a tree can predict the probability of the 
customer defaulting on the loan.

Medical Diagnosis: In healthcare, decision trees help diagnose diseases. 
For example, based on symptoms such as age, blood pressure, and test results, a decision tree can predict whether a 
patient is likely to have a certain disease.

Fraud Detection: In finance, decision trees are used to classify whether a transaction is fraudulent by analyzing features 
such as transaction amount, location, and frequency.
