# Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the **Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm** in Python. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem. It is widely used for text classification, spam detection, and other classification tasks due to its simplicity and efficiency.

### What is Naive Bayes?
Naive Bayes assumes that the features used for classification are independent of each other, which is why it is called "naive." Despite this simplifying assumption, it works well in many real-world applications, especially in scenarios where the data features are not highly interdependent.

### Use Cases
- **Text Classification**: Categorizing text documents into different categories like spam and non-spam emails.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying text based on positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Predicting the presence of a disease based on symptoms.
  
## Key Features
- Simple to implement and fast to train
- Effective for large datasets and real-time predictions
- Handles categorical and continuous data

## Installation
To use this Naive Bayes implementation, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries.

### Dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
